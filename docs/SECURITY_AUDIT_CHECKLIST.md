# Security Audit Checklist

**Purpose:** Comprehensive security audit checklist for the Port SDK  
**Frequency:** Before each major release (v1.0, v2.0, etc.) or annually  
**Last Audit:** Not yet performed  
**Next Audit:** Before v1.0.0 release

---

## Overview

This checklist ensures the Port SDK maintains the highest security standards. Use this for:
- Pre-release security audits
- Third-party security reviews
- Internal security assessments
- Compliance verification

---

## 1. Credential Management ✅

### 1.1 Storage
- [ ] Credentials never stored on disk
- [ ] Tokens kept in memory only
- [ ] No credentials in localStorage/sessionStorage
- [ ] No credentials in cookies (browser context)
- [ ] Environment variables properly scoped
- [ ] .env files in .gitignore

### 1.2 Transmission
- [ ] HTTPS enforced for all API calls
- [ ] No credentials in URL parameters
- [ ] No credentials in query strings
- [ ] Credentials only in Authorization headers
- [ ] TLS/SSL certificates validated
- [ ] No cleartext credential transmission

### 1.3 Logging
- [ ] Credentials sanitized in all logs
- [ ] No tokens in error messages
- [ ] No secrets in stack traces
- [ ] Debug logs don't expose credentials
- [ ] Test for credential leaks: `grep -r "clientSecret\|accessToken" logs/`

**Test:**
```bash
# Run SDK with logging enabled, verify no credentials appear
PORT_LOG_LEVEL=trace pnpm test 2>&1 | grep -i "secret\|token\|password"
# Should return no matches
```

---

## 2. Authentication & Authorization 🔐

### 2.1 OAuth Implementation
- [ ] OAuth 2.0 properly implemented
- [ ] Token refresh before expiry
- [ ] Race condition handling in token refresh
- [ ] No concurrent token refresh requests
- [ ] Token expiry properly validated
- [ ] Revoked tokens handled gracefully

### 2.2 Token Management
- [ ] Access tokens expire appropriately
- [ ] Refresh tokens (if used) stored securely
- [ ] Tokens cleared on logout/error
- [ ] No token reuse after expiry
- [ ] Token rotation supported

### 2.3 Authorization
- [ ] 401 errors handled properly
- [ ] 403 errors distinguished from 401
- [ ] Permission errors clear to users
- [ ] No privilege escalation possible

**Test:**
```bash
# Test invalid credentials
PORT_CLIENT_ID=invalid pnpm test:integration
# Should fail with PortAuthError

# Test token expiry
# (Manual test: use expired token)
```

---

## 3. Input Validation 🛡️

### 3.1 User Input
- [ ] All string inputs sanitized
- [ ] URL encoding applied correctly

- [ ] File paths validated
- [ ] Special characters handled

### 3.2 API Responses
- [ ] All API responses validated
- [ ] Type guards for unknown data
- [ ] No `any` types in response handling

### 3.3 Type Safety
- [ ] Strict TypeScript mode enabled
- [ ] No `any` types used
- [ ] All `unknown` types validated
- [ ] No unsafe type assertions
- [ ] `@ts-ignore` used only when necessary (and documented)

**Test:**
```bash
# Verify strict mode
grep -r "strict.*true" tsconfig.json

# Find any types
grep -r ":\s*any" src/
# Should return no matches

# Type check passes
pnpm type-check
```

**Test:**
```bash
# Verify HTTPS usage
grep -r "http://" src/ | grep -v "//http" | grep -v "localhost"
# Should only return comments/docs

# Check SSL validation
